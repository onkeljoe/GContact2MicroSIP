# GContact2MicroSIP

## Import Google contacts to MicroSIP - a tool for converting

This program was created in 2017 as part of my C# self-study.

As part of my personal blog, I wrote an article about MicroSIP, an open source project for a VOIP softphone. I connected MicroSIP to my Fritz!Box to use my PC as a telephone device. In response to the article, I received several comments complaining that MicroSIP is not set up to pull contacts from Google Contacts. So I took a closer look at MicroSIP's internal format and then decided to program my own converter. This is the result.

I also wrote an article about this GContact2MicroSIP tool on my blog: [Google Kontakte nach MicroSIP importieren – ein Tool zum Konvertieren](https://onkeljoe.de/google-kontakte-nach-microsip-importieren-ein-tool-zum-konvertieren/) In this article I provided a download link to a ready-to-use .exe file. Feel free to leave me a comment in the community section of my blog.
